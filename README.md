Cheng, S., Plouffe, R., Nanos, S.M. et al. The effect of average temperature on suicide rates in five urban California counties, 1999–⁠2019: an ecological time series analysis. *BMC Public Health* **21,** 974 (2021).

## Running this code

First, verify the required R packages are installed (see "load packages" at the beginning of the script). Next, run the script `california-counties-suicide-and-temperature.R` from the root directory. This can be achieved by either loading the project file `california-counties-suicide-and-temperature.Rproj` in RStudio or using `setwd()`. All required data has been provided in the `data` directory.

## Notes

This analysis was produced using R 4.0.3 but any modern version of R should work.
