Analysis code in R for the manuscript "The Effect of Average Temperature on Suicide Rates in Five Urban California Counties, 1999–⁠2019: An Ecological Time Series Analysis" by Sierra Cheng, Rebecca Plouffe, Stephanie M. Nanos, Mavra Qamar, David N. Fisman, and Jean-Paul R. Soucy.

## Running this code

First, verify the required R packages are installed (see "load packages" at the beginning of the script). Next, run the script `california-counties-suicide-and-temperature.R` from the root directory. This can be achieved by either loading the project file `california-counties-suicide-and-temperature.Rproj` in RStudio or using `setwd()`. All required data has been provided in the `data` directory.

## Notes

This analysis was produced using R 4.0.3 but any modern version of R should work.
